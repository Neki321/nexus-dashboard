NexusDB is a kind of personal digital hub where you can keep track of all your work processes.
It was important to me that the site was not just a to-do list, but a useful tool. That's why I implemented automatic statistics calculation: the system looks at all your projects and displays the total budget and average percentage of completion. If something changes in the plans, any project can be instantly edited, changed its status or deleted if it has become irrelevant. Search and filters work very fast, so even if there are a lot of projects, you can quickly find the one you need.
As for the technical part, I chose React and Vite, because it gives speed of work, and TypeScript helped me make the code more reliable and avoid a bunch of small errors at the writing stage. What I like most is that the application turned out to be autonomous.
